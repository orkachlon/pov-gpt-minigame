# POV: GPT
A minigame made as part of the Minigames 2023 course at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.<br>
In this game you play as an AI chatbot that needs to answer people's requests before they lose their patience.

Pixel art by me, the rest was done with [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/) and [AUTOMATIC1111's web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

### Implementation
The game was made in Unity, using Visual Scripting almost exclusively.
